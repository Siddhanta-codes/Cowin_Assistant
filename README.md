# Cowin_Assistant

In this project, I have made a chatbot using jupyter notebook and NLTK library.
This chatbot is still a work under process and I am still figuring out ways to make it more robust and more efficient.
Currently, this chatbot helps users to know how to register themselves on the Cowin Website and also answers the FAQs quite efficiently.
